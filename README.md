## Welcome!

This is my portfolio! Nothing too crazy here, just made a simple one page layout. 

There is a custom animation I made on scroll down where the container with information about me is transformed over. This was done by calculating the window position with the event listener for scroll down. Then I simply edited the css dynamically based on the position; the lower the position, the more the container slides over.
